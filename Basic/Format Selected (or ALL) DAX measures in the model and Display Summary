// This script, when executed, will loop through all selected measures (or all measures in the model if the _sMeasures = Model.AllMeasures) 
// and format DAX Expressions offering the possibility to choose Short or Long-line DAX formatting (default is long-line format)
// 
// When finished formatting an Info message appears on screen with a summary of what was executed: the total number of Measures formated and their names listed
// ====================================================================================================================================


//Selection of WHAT needs to be formatted: Switch <<Selected.Measures>> to << Model.AllMeasures>> to format ALL DAX measures in the Model
var _sMeasures = Selected.Measures;     

//Initialize a string to collect measure names
string _smNames = "";

//Loop throudh each selected measure to format DAX and collect Measurenames 
foreach(var m in _sMeasures) 
{
  m.Expression = "\n" + FormatDax(m.Expression, shortFormat: false);    // Switch shortFormat <<false>> to <<true>> for shorformat DAX 
  _smNames = _smNames + "\n     " + m.Name;
}

//Display in an info box summary for what was executed: number of formatted measures and their names
